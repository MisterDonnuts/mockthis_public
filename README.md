<h1 align="center">MockThis<br> - Create Mock data using AI</h1>

MockThis, is a web-app that makes it easy to create mock JSON to test your apps. It starts with a simple step: all you have to do is write down your class or interface definition in any code language, and you will get a mocked JSON response in an instant. To make it even better, MockThis uses AI to interpret the data and deliver accurate results quickly.

You don't have to waste time searching for different mocked JSONs or going back and forth between writing and copy pasting. You can get realistic results in a fraction of the time.

Use MockThis its super easy, if you want a JSON of your classes, just paste them in the box, click submit and Voila! (ok... its no that fast) you can use this feature to just get information about anything you need and describe in the interface the way you want this data will be delivered.
Also you can send a JSON to get generate classes, interfaces, objects or whatever you want in any code lenguaje, just flip the cards, paste your JSON, write the desired result (and if you have especial requierements like use specific decorators you can write it clickin in the "add notes" button).
